  "recipe": "<p>I was looking through the NY style pizza recipes on the forum looking for an easy approach- one that didn't use exotic ingredients or equipment, and couldn't find one that I felt covered all the bases.  So, here's my contribution to the easy equation (note: this is easy, but not fast).<br><br/> Step #1. You will need a pizza stone to successfully bake this pizza in a home oven.  If you don't have one, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201112012454/http://www.axner.com/cordierite-shelf-18x18x1square.aspx\" class=\"bbc_link\" target=\"_blank\">order this</a>.  If your oven oven isn't large enough, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201112012454/http://www.axner.com/cordierite-shelf-16x16x34square.aspx\" class=\"bbc_link\" target=\"_blank\">order this smaller baking stone</a>. <br/> <br>Makes one 16\" pie <br><table class=\"bbc_table\"><tbody><tr><td>King Arthur Bread Flour (100%):<br>Water (room temp) (61%):<br>IDY (.5%):<br>Salt (1.75%):<br>Soybean Oil (3%):<br>Sugar (1%):<br>Total (167.25%):<br></td><td>289.69 g  |  10.22 oz | 0.64 lbs<br>176.71 g  |  6.23 oz | 0.39 lbs<br>1.45 g | 0.05 oz | 0 lbs | 0.48 tsp | 0.16 tbsp<br>5.07 g | 0.18 oz | 0.01 lbs | 0.91 tsp | 0.3 tbsp<br>8.69 g | 0.31 oz | 0.02 lbs | 1.93 tsp | 0.64 tbsp<br>2.9 g | 0.1 oz | 0.01 lbs | 0.73 tsp | 0.24 tbsp<br>484.51 g | 17.09 oz | 1.07 lbs | TF = 0.085<br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>Measure dry (no yeast). Measure wet (+ yeast). Mix to dissolve yeast. Dry into wet. Stir with a metal spoon until it's too stiff to stir, then knead, by hand or by machine, until the dough is just about smooth (3-6 minutes).
