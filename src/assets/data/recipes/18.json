  "recipe": "<p>Place half of the total flour and all of the yeast in the bowl of an electric mixer.  Add all of the water and mix with the dough hook (and a little manual coaxing) until thoroughly combined into a batter.  Rest the dough a couple of minutes.  Then add about half the remaining flour and mix for two minutes on low.  At this point the dough will transform from a batter into a really wet dough, and the dough hook will have a chance to really develop the gluten.  After two minutes increase the speed by one level, and add the salt.  Mix for one minute. Rest the dough for two minutes. Then add the rest of the remaining flour and mix for two more minutes.  The dough should then be smooth and extensible.  If not, mix for another two minutes.  <br/> <br/> Cover the mixer bowl and allow the dough to rise for two hours.  Then scale and form dough balls, and store them in oiled, individual plastic containers (such as Rubbermaid or Glad food storage containers). Transfer the containers to the refrigerator for a nice long nap at least 2 days and up to 10 days).  <br/> <br/> This is probably one of the best loved and most discussed recipes on the Pizzamaking.com forum.
