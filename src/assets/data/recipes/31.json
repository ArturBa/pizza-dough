  "recipe": "<p>Per Andrew: <br/> <br/> If the weather is hot &amp; humid, use very cold water. Otherwise, room temperature is OK.  Throw the water in the mixer and add all ingredients but the flour. Stir well with a whisk until combined.  Add the flour.  Mix on low speed for 8 minutes.<br/> <br/> You now have the dough recipe for everyplace I've ever been.  Including Lombardi's.<br/> <br/> Good pizza has been around long before hydration formulas and such.  Don't get so wrapped up into what is really a very simple process.  Because that's what pizza is supposed to be.  Plain. Simple. Food.<br/> <br/> </p> "
