  "recipe": "<p>In a mixing bowl, add the water, sugar, yeast, flour, cornmeal, and salt.  Mix on low speed for a few minutes until the dough comes together, then slowly add the oil. Continue to mix dough for 7 more minutes.  The dough should be somewhat moist and smooth, not sticky.  Form the dough into a ball and place into a bowl. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and then with a dish towel and place in the refrigerator for an overnight rise.<br/> <br/> For complete instructions on how to make the DKM Deep Dish Pizza, please follow the link below.  </p> "
